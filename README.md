# Fix my code

This project focuses on fixing the code base of [another repository](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge). The main challenge here is that some files are written in a language we may not know.

## Contents

**0. FizzBuzz (Python)**: FizzBuzz is not displaying when a number is divisible by both three (3) and five (5).
**1. Print square (JavaScript)**: Specifying an bigger size will return an even bigger square
**2. Sort (Ruby)**: The sorting algorithm is as functional as the [Bogo sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaPJkYo2quc).
**3. User password (Python)**: Something is wrong with the implementation of the password aspect of this User class.
**4. Double linked list (C)**: Deletion of the linked list acts weird.
